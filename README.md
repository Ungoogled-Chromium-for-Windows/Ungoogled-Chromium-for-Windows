## ‚ùì What is Ungoogled Chromium?

Ungoogled Chromium is a web browser built directly from the open-source Chromium engine, stripped of all Google integrations and services. It offers a minimal, fast, and private browsing experience while maintaining full compatibility with modern web standards.

Unlike mainstream browsers, Ungoogled Chromium disables background connections to Google servers and removes features that can leak user data. The result is a lightweight and privacy-respecting browser with no auto-updates, no account syncing, and no built-in telemetry.

It supports Chrome extensions (with manual installation), bookmark import, developer tools, and user customization via flags and settings. Whether you‚Äôre seeking a cleaner alternative to Chrome or want a browser with zero tracking, Ungoogled Chromium gives you control without compromise.
